# Software Developer | AI Newbie
By day, I work at an IT company and help customers deliver the best software. By night, I'm a geek who builds apps and stays fit. Currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence—because if the machines take over, I at least want a front-row seat 🍿.

My brain runs on caffeine, music, and dystopian novels 📚.
